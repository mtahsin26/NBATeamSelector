Javascript NBA Team selector project


- This website is written in pure javascript to dynamically create elements, animations etc. to select players and create an imaginary NBA All-Star team. 
- This app uses AJAX functionality to fetch player info from an XML file. Users are also able to save their NBA player lineups through local storage

- Website needs to run on a server for ajax calls to function properly or else data from XML will not show
- XML player data was created manually to mock a simple API. (Rosters are accurate as of 2011-2012 season) Data found in playerData.xml
